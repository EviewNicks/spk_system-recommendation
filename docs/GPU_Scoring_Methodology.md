# GPU Scoring Methodology

## Overview

This document explains the evidence-based GPU scoring methodology developed for the system recommendation engine. The scoring system uses objective benchmark data from authoritative sources to calculate standardized GPU performance scores.

## Data Sources

The scoring methodology is based on comprehensive benchmark data from:

1. **3DMark Time Spy Scores** - Industry standard DirectX 12 gaming benchmark
2. **PassMark G3D Mark** - Comprehensive GPU performance database
3. **Real-world Gaming Performance** - FPS data from popular titles at 1080p/1440p
4. **Academic GPU Studies** - Performance analysis from research papers
5. **Manufacturer Specifications** - VRAM, architecture, and generation data

## Scoring Formula

### Final Score Calculation
```
Final Score = Base Score × Generation Multiplier × VRAM Factor
```

Where:
- **Base Score**: Normalized from 3DMark Time Spy benchmark (0-100 scale)
- **Generation Multiplier**: Accounts for architectural improvements
- **VRAM Factor**: Considers memory bandwidth and capacity impact

### Base Score Normalization
- **3DMark Time Spy** scores normalized to 0-100 scale
- RTX 4090 (36,102 points) = 100 base score
- Scores calculated as: `(GPU_Score / 36102) × 100`

### Generation Multipliers
- **RTX 40 Series**: 1.40 (Ada Lovelace architecture)
- **RTX 30 Series**: 1.25 (Ampere architecture)
- **RX 7000 Series**: 1.35 (RDNA 3 architecture)
- **RX 6000 Series**: 1.25 (RDNA 2 architecture)
- **Apple M2**: 1.05 (Improved architecture)
- **Apple M1**: 1.00 (Baseline)
- **Intel Arc**: 1.15 (Xe-HPG architecture)
- **Older GPUs**: 0.80-0.95 (Legacy architectures)

### VRAM Factors
- **24GB**: 1.30 (Flagship level)
- **16GB**: 1.25 (High-end)
- **12GB**: 1.20 (Upper mid-range)
- **8GB**: 1.15 (Mainstream)
- **6GB**: 1.10 (Entry-level gaming)
- **4GB**: 1.05 (Basic gaming)
- **2GB**: 0.95 (Limited gaming)
- **Integrated**: 0.90 (Shared memory)
